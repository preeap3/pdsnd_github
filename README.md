### Project Title
The title of the project is bikeshare.py

### Description
I wrote code in order to provide useful information about bikeshare users and station statistics using user input.

### Files used
chicago.csv
washington.csv
new_york_city.csv

### Credits
Used this as a reference to write code on line 66 and 67 to filter for month and day but was unable to run it without error. Also, not sure how one can obtain information on most common month if a filter is applied ahead of time for month.

The rest of the code was written using examples of tasks done prior to in Project Bikeshare.
